//! # ds
//!
//! `ds` is a library that allows for control of FIRST Robotics Competition robots.
//! The protocol supported currently is that of the 2018 season, with only the bare minimum
//! required to control the robot currently consumed. Diagnostic and telemetry information is not decoded and is discarded
//!
//! The core trait for use of the crate is the [`DriverStation`](struct.DriverStation.html) crate. This crate
//! provides an API for connecting and controlling to the roboRIO in an FRC robot. It also allows for users to
//! provide joystick input using arbitrary APIs, and to consume any incoming TCP packets.
